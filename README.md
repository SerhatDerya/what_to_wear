# What to Wear?

What to Wear is an AI model which makes suggestions about what to wear when going out.

Note 1: Github didn't allow me to upload the model. As soon as I figure it out, I will share it.

Note 2: The model was trained on my data. So it might not work you. If this is the case, try creating your own model by using this model as canvas.
